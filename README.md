# Library-Management-System
This is a Java-based Library Management System project designed to help manage the operations of a library. It provides a User-Interface for librarians to handle tasks such as adding, updating, and deleting books, managing members, issuing and returning books, and generating reports.

Tools Used
•	Java Development Kit (JDK)
•	Java Swing Library
•	SQLite Database

Features
•	Book Management: Librarians can add new books to the system, update existing book details (e.g., title, author, publication), and delete books if necessary.
•	Member Management: The system allows librarians to manage library members by adding new members, updating their information (e.g., name, contact details), and 
                    removing members when needed.
•	Book Issuing: Librarians can issue books to members by recording the member's ID and the book's ID. The system keeps track of the issued books and their due dates.
•	Book Return: When a member returns a book, librarians can update the system to mark the book as returned and calculate any applicable fines or penalties.
•	Reports: The system generates various reports for better management, including a list of all books, a list of all members, a list of currently issued books, and a  
            list of books overdue
